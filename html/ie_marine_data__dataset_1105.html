                        <p>SALSEA-Merge was a three year scientific project to investigate the migration and distribution of salmon in the North-East Atlantic. The project was supported by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological development. Funding was also provided by the Partner organisations, the Total Foundation and the Atlantic Salmon Trust. SALSEA-Merge was officially launched on the 16 May 2008 in Killybegs, Ireland.

This survey took place in the May of 2008 on board the Marine Institute&#39;s R.V. Celtic Explorer in the North East Atlantic Ocean along the Hebridean Shelf and Slope. Trawling was carried out to sample post salmon smolts and other pelagic fish. Conductivity - Temperature - Depth profiles were carried out to profile the water column. In addition, samples of plankton were taken at several stations where smolts were encountered. </p>
