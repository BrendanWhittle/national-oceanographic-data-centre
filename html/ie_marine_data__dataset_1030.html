                        <p>The INtegrated Mapping FOr the Sustainable Development of Irelandâ€™s MArine Resource (INFOMAR) programme is a joint venture between the Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) and the Marine Institute (MI). The programme is a successor to the Irish National Seabed Survey (INSS) and concentrates on creating a range of integrated mapping products of the physical, chemical and biological features of the seabed in the near-shore area.

This cruise took place on board the R.V. Celtic Explorer in April/May 2007 in the North East Atlantic Ocean in an area offshore the Dingle peninsula, Co. Kerry.  

Surveys conducted include:
Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES) hydrographic survey to International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO) Order 1a standard. 
Bathymetry survey: to produce bathymetry shaded relief and backscatter mosaic products which provide depth, seabed features and seabed hardness information. 
Sub Bottom Profiler (SBP) survey: to acquire data of the shallow (up to 30 metres) sub seabed to determine the existence of buried objects and ascertain the sub-seabed character. 

182 survey lines, cross lines and infill lines were completed. A total of 10 Sound Velocity profiles (SVPs), 11 Moving Vessel Profile (MVP) casts and 25 Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD)  casts (including a completed transect) were taken. A total of 49 stations were sampled. At each station 4 grabs were taken; 3 for biological analysis and 1 for geochemical analysis. An area of 2899 km2 was covered during this survey. 

No Marine Mammal Observer was on board so no cetacean recordings were logged. </p>
