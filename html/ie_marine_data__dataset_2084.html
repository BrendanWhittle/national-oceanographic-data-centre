                        <p>The INtegrated Mapping FOr the Sustainable Development of Irelandâ€™s MArine Resource (INFOMAR) programme is a joint venture between the Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) and the Marine Institute (MI). The programme is a successor to the Irish National Seabed Survey (INSS) and concentrates on creating a range of integrated mapping products of the physical, chemical and biological features of the seabed in the near-shore area.

This 16 day survey took place on board the RV Celtic Voyager in 2016 from  24th July - 8th August in the Celtic Sea, offshore Cork.

Surveys conducted include:
Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES) hydrographic survey to International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO) Order 1a standard. 
Bathymetry survey: to produce bathymetry shaded relief and backscatter mosaic products which provide depth, seabed features and seabed hardness information. 
Sub Bottom Profiler (SBP) survey: to acquire data of the shallow (up to 30 metres) sub seabed to determine the existence of buried objects and ascertain the sub-seabed character. 
A magnetometer was used to acquire data  on sub seabed geology to provide information on manmade seafloor debris. 
Shipwrecks were also surveyed. 

An area of 833km2 was covered during this survey. </p>
