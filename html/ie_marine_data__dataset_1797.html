                        <p>This survey was conducted by the Marine Institute on-board the RV Celtic Explorer in summer 2009 as part of the North West Herring Acoustic Survey. 

The northwest and west coast (ICES Divisions VIaS &amp; VIIb) herring acoustic survey programme was first established in 1994. This survey represents the second in the new time series. In 2004, a single spawing stock survey was carried out early in quarter 1 and continued until 2007. It was then decided that the survey should be incorporated into the larger coordinated Malin shelf survey in 2008. 

The survey was coordinated through the ICES Working Group of International Pelagic Surveys (WGIPS). Survey data on stock numbers at age are submitted to the ICES Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) and used in the annual stock assessment process. 

The northwest and west coast (ICES Divisions VIaS &amp; VIIb) herring stock is composed of two spawning components, autumn and winter spawners. Spawning covers a large geographical area and extends over a 4-month period from late September through to late March. Traditionally, fishing effort has been concentrated on spawning and pre-spawning aggregations. The autumn spawning component, which mostly occurs within VIIb and VIaS, feeds along the shelf break area to the west of the spawning grounds. The winter spawning component is found further north in VIaS. In VIaS, summer distribution extends from close inshore to the shelf break. Components of the winter spawning fish are known to undertake northward feeding migration into VIaN before returning in the winter to spawn along the Irish coast.

This survey, carried out between 3rd - 22nd July, focused on the northwest and west coast of Ireland. To keep in line with existing survey methodology acoustic data collection was only undertaken during daylight hours (04:00 and 00:00). A systematic parallel transect design was adopted with a randomised start point. Transects were positioned running perpendicular to the lines of bathymetry where possible.

The acoustic data were collected using the Simrad ER60 scientific echosounder. For biological sampling, a single pelagic midwater trawl was used. 31 hauls were carried out. All components of the catch from the trawl hauls were sorted and weighed; fish and other taxa were identified to species level. Oceanographic stations were carried out during the survey at predetermined locations along the track.
