    dct:abstract "This inter-institutional survey, led by University College Dublin (UCD), took place on board the Marine Institute's R.V. Celtic Explorer in October/November 2015 in the Gulf of Cadiz. The aim of the survey was to assess the role of geothermal fluids emitted from points of venting (geothermal mud-volcanoes) on cold-water corals and sponge gardens in habitat diversification, biomass accumulation and biodiversity. The three planned sites were surveyed, as well as an additonal one. 

Mapping/CTD – prior to multi-beaming a sound velocity profile (SVP) was acquired using the CTD. At the same time as colleting SVP data the CTD was used to collect oceanic water for isotope and eDNA analyses. Multinet – a multinet was deployed to sample plankton at three different depths (same depth as the CTD water samples) both day and night to allow for assessing differences in biodiversity in the epipelagic and mesopelagic during light and dark hours. Gravity core – sediment samples were collected using a gravity corer (5m) to retrieve sediments for chemical analyses at each mud-volcano. No coring was performed at the coral control site. ROV – The Holland 1 ROV was deployed at each site to collect hard samples, acquire high-def video, ROV based cores and temperature profiles from seep areas.";
