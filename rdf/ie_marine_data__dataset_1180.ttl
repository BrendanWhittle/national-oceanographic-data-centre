    dct:abstract "This 16 day bio-discovery and deep ocean ecosystems survey, led by National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG), took place in April 2012 on board the Marine Institute's R.V. Celtic Explorer in the North East Atlantic Ocean. 

This was a multidisciplinary deep-sea research cruise, combining two components: bio-discovery, and ecosystem functioning and nutrient recycling.  Both components are inter-institutional and interdisciplinary. The survey used the remotely operated vehicle ROV Holland 1 to survey the area and collect  marine specimens. CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) sampling was also conducted at ROV dive sites where possible.
