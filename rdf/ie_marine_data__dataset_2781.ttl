    sdo:name "Irish Wave Energy Resource Atlas";
    dct:abstract "The Irish Wave Power Atlas published in 2005 describes an initial comparison between several years of hourly wave forecasts (using WAM) on a grid of points located off the Irish coast with corresponding records from a number of buoys installed in recent years. Based on the level of agreement found the wave forecasts were then modified slightly and used to estimate and map the mean annual power and energy resources at the theoretical, technical, practicable and accessible levels. Spatial data from the atlas consists of shapefile layers generated by the Pelamis model. Annual Average Wave Height (m), Annual Average Wave Period (s), Annual Average Power Practicable (MW), Annual Pelamis Energy (MW), Seasonal Average Power Flux kW (kW), Seasonal Hydro Energy MW hours (MW), Seasonal Pelamis Average Power MW (MW) and Seasonal Pelamis Energy GW hours (GW).";
