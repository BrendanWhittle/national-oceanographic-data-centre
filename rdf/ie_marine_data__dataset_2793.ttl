Phytoplankton samples are taken from 79 inshore stations close to the Irish coastline between Co. Louth and Co. Donegal but mainly along the west coast of Ireland. Phytoplankton sample stations are regularly sampled around the Irish coastline as part of the HABs monitoring programme since 2002. Water samples for phytoplankton counts analysis in the lab taken by observers and delivered to the Irish Marine Institute. Phytoplankton counts analysis supports water quality monitoring and early warning for naturally occurring harmful algal blooms known as red tides. Samples are managed by the Marine Institute in partnership with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.";
