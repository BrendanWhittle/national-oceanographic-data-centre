Condcuting CTD stations to measure salinity, water temperature and other key features of the water column overlying the slopes and canyon systems of the Porcupine Bank, Sea Bight and Whittard Canyon.
There may be scope to reduce the number of sampling stations to facilitate a project requiring night-time trawls and/or benthic sampling. (tbc)";
