    dct:abstract "A vibrocorer is used to extract cores of soft sediment up to six metres in length from the seabed subsurface for engineering site investigations or palaeo-environmental research. Cores are typically acquired either using a motor driven vibration technique which drives the core barrel into the sediment, or by a weighted core barrel method where the device is dropped and free-falls into the seabed.";
