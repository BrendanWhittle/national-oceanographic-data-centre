    dct:abstract "The current system of Local Government in the Republic of Ireland comprises of 31 Local Authorities. Local Government and the right of local self-government is a cornerstone of any modern democracy. Irish Local Authorities are the closest and most accessible form of Government to people in their local community. They also have responsibility for delivery of a wide range of services in their local area with a focus on making towns and cities attractive places to live, work and invest. 

These services generally include housing; planning; roads; water supply; environmental protection; provision of recreation and amenities and community infrastructure. Local Authorities also play a key role in supporting economic development and enterprise at a local level. 

Local Government support on the ground is critical to the success of many initiatives which drive local communities. These range from local festivals and events; design of streetscapes and village renewal schemes; support for micro-enterprises, business parks and incubation units; involvement in energy efficiency projects; promotion of rural broadband; planning for major investments in the green economy.
