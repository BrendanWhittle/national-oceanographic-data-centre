    dct:abstract "This survey, led by University College Cork (UCC), took place on board the Marine Institute's R.V. Celtic Explorer in June 2015. The survey was carried out to  study cold-water coral reefs in two different Special Areas of Conservation (SACs),  the Belgica Mound SAC and the Porcupine Bank Canyon SAC, in differing seabed contexts. This survey produced new mapping coverages of the Moira Mounds whose location, distribution and abundance were vaguely known previously. Groundtruthing using ROV (Holland 1) inspection verified the maps.

Reconnaisance mapping of the number of cold-water coral reef mounds was carried out. The ROV was used to record video footage of the corals. CTD (Conductivity, Temperature and Depth) profiles obtained and gravity core sampling carried out to quantitatively investigate biomineralized microfauna, coupled with geochemical analyses.";
