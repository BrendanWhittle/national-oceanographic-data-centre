The programme is a successor to the Irish National Seabed Survey (INSS) and concentrates on creating a range of integrated mapping products of the physical, chemical and biological features of the seabed in the near-shore area.

This two day survey took place on board the R.V. Celtic Voyager in January 2016 in Cork Harbour to trial seabed mapping equipment.  Tests on the multibeam echosounder, magnetometers and two Sound Velocity Profiles (SVPs) were carried out.
