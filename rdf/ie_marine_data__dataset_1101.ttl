    dct:abstract "This multidisciplinary survey took place over two legs in January 2013, led by the Marine Institute. The cruise incorporates physical, chemical and biological data gathering. 

The first leg of the survey focused on the recovery of the PAP 1 weather buoy owned by UK Met Office and gliders from the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) site for the  National Oceanography Centre (NOC) and University of East Anglia (UEA). The second leg focused on oceanographic section and geological work for Geological Survey Ireland (GSI) and the servicing of the M6 weather buoy.

A total of 36 CTD sampling stations were occupied for a variety of parameters including nutrients, salinity and carbon measurements. Grab sampling and rock dredging was conducted at a number of additional stations.
