    sdo:name "CE14015 Irish Groundfish Survey Leg 1";
    dct:abstract "The Marine Institute (MI) conducts annual groundfish surveys to determine the distribution and abundance of commercial fish around Ireland. 

The Irish Groundfish Survey (IGFS) forms part of the International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) programme, an international survey effort coordinated by the International Council of the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). Each year the survey, taking place in Autumn/Winter, collects demersal trawl and ancillary data in Irish waters to produce relative abundance indices for fisheries management.  In particular the survey provides an index of the share of young fish in the stock, which in turn gives an indication of its spawning success. The IGFS contributes to Ireland’s international obligation to supply scientific data that support the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). 

In Irish waters, France and Ireland survey the Celtic Sea area, Ireland surveys the shelf West of Ireland, Ireland and the UK Scotland cover the north coast of Ireland and the UK and Northern Ireland survey the Irish Sea. 

The 2014 Survey by the MI took place over 4 legs on board the RV Celtic Explorer. The more northerly ICES Area (leg 1) took place in late September and early October using a Rockhopper groundgear rig, and the western and southern areas were carried out in three legs (legs 2,3 and 4) during November – December using a finer groundgear. 

In order to make data as comparable as possible, each survey operates under a set of agreed standard protocols. Each tow is 30min long and takes place during daylight hours at 3.5-4 knots. Net geometry and ground contact is monitored and logged. All fish and commercial shellfish are sorted to species level prior to taking lengths and other biological measurements such as age, sex and maturity.
