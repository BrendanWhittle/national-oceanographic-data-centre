    dct:abstract "INFOMAR backscatter data is measured primarily by multibeam (MBES) and also singlebeam(SBES) echosounder devices. MBES transducers transmit multiple a high frequency pulses of sound from beneath a vessel in a fan shape down to the seabed.  

The amount of energy reflected back to the vessel for each pulse of sound is termed the backscatter.   The amount of energy returned will depend on the seabed type, for example a softer bottom such as mud will return a weaker signal than a harder bottom, like rock.  Backscatter therefore can be used to infer seabed type.";
