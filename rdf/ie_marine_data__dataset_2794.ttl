The inshore production areas cover an area of the coastline of the Republic of Ireland. Production areas establish under the HABs programme 2002. Administrative units support reporting of areas as Open, Closed Pending and Closed for aquaculture production activities. Administrative units follow natural bay and inlet boundaries of the Irish coastline. HABs boundaries generated by the HABs team within Marine Environment and Food Safety Services (MEFSS) of the Marine Institute (MI). Boundaries complete and correct as per HABs monitoring programme.";
