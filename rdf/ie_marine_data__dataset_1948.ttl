The programme is a successor to the Irish National Seabed Survey (INSS) and concentrates on creating a range of integrated mapping products of the physical, chemical and biological features of the seabed in the near-shore area.

This survey took place on board the RV Celtic Voyager in August/September 2017 in the Celtic Sea, offshore Waterford and Wexford.  Two discrete survey areas were mapped.  The smallest of these, a bad weather contingency area is due south of the entrance to Cork Harbour and the larger one approximately 60 km due east of this. Approximately 983 km2 of seabed was surveyed in total. ";
