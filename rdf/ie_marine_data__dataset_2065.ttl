    dct:abstract "Annual Nephrops Galway Bay (Aran) and Porcupine Underwater television (UWTV) Survey undertaken by Marine Institute. This survey took place in June 2016 on board the R.V. Celtic Voyager.  

Nephrops is a genus of lobsters comprising a single extant species Nephrops norvegicus (the Norway lobster or Dublin Bay prawn). It is common around the Irish coast occurring in geographically distinct sandy/muddy areas where the sediment is suitable for them to construct their burrows. The Nephrops fishery is extremely valuable. Underwater television surveys and assessment methodologies have been developed to provide a fishery independent estimate of stock size, exploitation status and catch advice. 

This was a multi-disciplinary survey collecting UWTV, fishing, Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) and other ecosystem data. 34 UWTV stations were successfully completed on the Aran Grounds, 7 on Galway Bay, 4 on Slyne Head patches and 65 on the Porcupine Bank Nephrops grounds.";
