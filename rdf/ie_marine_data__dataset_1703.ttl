Hydroacoustic detection of gas bubbles using single/split beam echo sounders.

The following activity will largely be undertaken during day time :
Deployment of landers to perform in situ gas flux measurements.
Deployment of ROV Kiel 6000 for detailed sampling of sediments and deployment of instruments on the seafloor.
Deployment of a vibrocorer for recovery of long sediment cores for porewater analysis. (10 cores total)";
