    dct:abstract "The Full Scale Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) provides 30 minute observational data from two directional waverider buoys known as Belmullet A and Belmullet B observing and measuring wave height, wave direction and wave period. The AMETS buoys are located in the North Atlantic Ocean in waters off the coast of the Erris Peninsula in Co. Mayo at 50m and 100m bathymetry depths. AMETS has been collecting data since 2012. A directional Waverider is a wave motion sensor stabilised platform that can measure the properties of waves including height, direction and period. The AMETS programme has been jointly managed by the Marine Institute and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Data coverage 100% for when the buoys have been operational. Any data gaps in time period indicate the buoy(s) have been non-operational and have been under maintenance.";
