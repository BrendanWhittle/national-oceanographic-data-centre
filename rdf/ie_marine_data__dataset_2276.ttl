    dct:abstract "This dataset provides results of mean offshore wind speed measured in metres per second at a height 100m above sea level. Wind speed is the rate of the movement of wind in distance per unit of time. It is the rate of the movement of air flow. The geographic coverage of wind speed includes an area including the Irish Internal Waters and the Irish Territorial Sea up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline. Wind speed measurements modelled during 2003. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) Wind Atlas 2003 was a digital map of Ireland's wind energy resource. The SEAI is Ireland's national sustainable energy authority tasked with making Ireland’s energy sustainable, secure, affordable, and clean. Wind speed measurements were created to support wind energy resource potential to assist all those concerned with the wind planning process and be of great use to developers and policy makers alike. Data completed during 2003 for geographic area coverage.";
