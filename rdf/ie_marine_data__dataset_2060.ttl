    dct:abstract "The INtegrated Mapping FOr the Sustainable Development of Ireland’s MArine Resource (INFOMAR) programme is a joint venture between the Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) and the Marine Institute (MI). The programme is a successor to the Irish National Seabed Survey (INSS) and concentrates on creating a range of integrated mapping products of the physical, chemical and biological features of the seabed in the near-shore area.

This survey took place on board the RV Celtic Voyager in 2016 from 26th May - 8th June in the Atlantic Ocean, offshore Co. Mayo. 

Surveys conducted include:
Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES) hydrographic survey to International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO) Order 1a in water depths less than 100 metres and Order 2 in depths greater than 100 metres. 
Bathymetry survey: to produce bathymetry shaded relief and backscatter mosaic products which provide depth, seabed features and seabed hardness information. 
Sub Bottom Profiler (SBP) survey: to acquire data of the shallow (up to 30 metres) sub seabed to determine the existence of buried objects and ascertain the sub-seabed character. 
A magnetometer was used to acquire data  on sub seabed geology to provide information on manmade seafloor debris. 
Shipwrecks were also surveyed. 

An area of 944km2 was covered during this survey and water depths varied from 20 metres to over 200 metres at the shelf edge.";
