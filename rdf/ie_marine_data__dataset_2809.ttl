The dataset avaialble here is a research and development demonstration product only and as such is not suitable for Marine Spatial Planning or other similar purposes.

The dataset delineates Atlantic marine waters around Ireland that meet all the criteria below:

 - water depth ≥ 15 m
 - maximum tidal velocity of < 1 m/s
 - maximum significant wave height, max_Hs, < 4 m
 - Ninetieth percentile value of a significant wave height (Hs), Hs_P90 < 2 m";
