    dct:abstract "Magnetism is the force of attraction or repulsion between substances. Many rocks have a magnetic component, caused by the presence of magnetic minerals within the rocks themselves which change the Earth's magnetic field around them. INFOMAR surveys use a magnetometer tow-fish to measure variations in the Earths magnetic field caused by iron rich rock bodies and shipwrecks containing metal cargo and or vessels made from metal. ";
