    dct:abstract "The Accessible Wave Energy Resource Atlas published in 2005 describes an initial comparison between several years of hourly wave forecasts (using WAM) on a grid of points located off the Irish coast with corresponding records from a number of buoys installed in recent years. Based on the level of agreement found the wave forecasts were then modified slightly and used to estimate the mean annual practicable power resource around Ireland.";
