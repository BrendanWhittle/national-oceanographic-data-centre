    dct:abstract "Water colour is measured routinely in the Burrishoole catchment at several different locations as part of the ongoing LTER (long term ecological research) program of monitoring. Water colour is a good proxy measurement of DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon). This dataset is compilation of approximately weekly measurements taken at three locations (Black River, Glenamong River and Srahrevagh River) between 2004 and 2016. The dataset also includes hydrological, meteorological and climatological variables related to the control of water colour.
