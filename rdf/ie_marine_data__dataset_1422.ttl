The purposed of the Seabed Survey project is to map the seabed collecting detailed bathymetry (water depth) data and knowledge of the nature of the seabed and its overlying sediment. In addition, Magnetic and gravity techniques are helping to evaluate the nature and structure of the deeper geology. 
The summer cruises of 2003 focused on Zone 2, the 50-200m contour and involved three 6 week cruises.	 ";
