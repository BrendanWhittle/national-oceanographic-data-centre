A combination of a relatively small British and Irish Ice Sheet, located adjacent to the much larger Fennoscandanavian Ice Sheet, means that the spatially complex RSL records observed at different locations in the UK and Ireland provide a rich database for resolving the processes that control global to local sea-level change.

This vibrocoring geological survey sought to address the issue of the RSL lowstand in the western British Isles. This survey took place in June 2012 on board the Marine Institute's R.V. Celtic Explorer. A total of 148 vibrocores were obtained.  ";
