The Seabed Survey aims to map the seabed collecting detailed bathymetry (water depth) data and knowledge of the nature of the seabed and its overlying sediment. In addition, Magnetic and gravity techniques are helping to evaluate the nature and structure of the deeper geology. 
This cruise is concentrating on waters in Zone 1 between 0-50m off the Irish coast.";
