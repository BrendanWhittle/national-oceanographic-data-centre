    dct:abstract "The GO-SHIP A02 survey was completed in April/May 2017 on the RV Celtic Explorer, travelling from St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, across the North Atlantic to Galway, Ireland. A total of 67 stations were occupied along the A02 transect, with 1231 nutrient samples analysed for total oxidised nitrogen (TOxN), nitrite, phosphate and silicate on a Skalar San continuous flow auto-analyser. Sampling, sample preservation and analytical procedures on both systems followed methods outlined in the GO-SHIP guidelines for nutrient analysis at sea (Hydes et al., 2010), while also incorporating existing laboratory methods and quality control. TOxN, silicate and phosphate were analysed at sea, typically within 12 hours of sampling. Due to analytical issues at sea, the nitrite data are from analysis of frozen samples in the laboratory at the Marine Institute following the survey.";
