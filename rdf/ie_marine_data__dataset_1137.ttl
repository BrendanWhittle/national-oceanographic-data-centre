    dct:abstract "This survey, led by IFM-Geomar in the North Sea, was conducted in July-August 2009 on board the Marine Institute's R.V. Celtic Explorer. 

The aim of the SDNS project is to detect sites of active fluid and gas seepage in the North Sea, to decipher and map possible migration pathways in the Pleistocene and Holocene deposits, to quantify gas fluxes in the water column related to tides and currents, and to analyze the chemical compositions of emitted fluids and gases, in order to investigate relationship of fluid/gas seepage to subsurface reservoir geochemistry, sediment deposits and migration structures. 

Conventional echosounder, ADCP, and multi beam techniques are applied to get background information about sea surface morphology (e.g. pockmarks), shallow sediment characteristics and physical oceanography. Conductvity, Temperature and Depth casts was also carried out to profile the water column and  to help detect gas seepage. Sediment and porewater studies were also performed during the cruise.";
