    dct:abstract "The iShip Index is a quarterly weighted indicator that gauges the health of the Irish shipping industry. The index is comprised of five separate indices, representing the main maritime traffic categories moving through ports in the Republic of Ireland: LoLo, RoRo, Dry Bulk, Liquid Bulk and Break Bulk. As all three bulk segments are traditionally measured in tonnes, LoLo and RoRo traffic are converted into tonnage terms, whereby 1teu = 10 tonnes and 1 Freight Unit = 14 tonnes, thus establishing a common denominator.";
