    dct:abstract "This survey took place onboard the R/V Celtic Explorer on behalf of the MESH (Mapping European Seabed Habitats) European Union INTERREG IIIb project.  The cruise took place between the 4th and 18th of June 2007.

The study area is located 320km to the southwest of Land’s End  .  The area surveyed comprises continental shelf sloping south-westwards to the shelfbreak which occurs at a depth of approximately 200m.  From there it passes down to the much steeper, deeply incised (canyoned) continental slope.  The area surveyed includes two canyons and the eastern flank of a third canyon, straddling the UK/Irish median line.  Due to the constraints of the multibeam system used for this survey, no data could be collected in water depths greater than 1165m. ";
