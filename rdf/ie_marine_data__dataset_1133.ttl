This survey took place in the summer of 2009 on board the Marine Institute's R.V. Celtic Explorer in the North East Atlantic Ocean and Norwegian Sea. Trawling was carried out to sample post salmon smolts and other pelagic fish. CTD (Conductivity - Temperature - Depth) profiles were carried out to profile the water column. ";
