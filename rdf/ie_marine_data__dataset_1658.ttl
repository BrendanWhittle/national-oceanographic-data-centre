The main objective of the survey was to characterise the preferred habitat of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in offshore waters by relating animal densities (relative abundance) to important habitat covariates (depth, distance from shelf edge and various oceanographic variables) using zero-inflated and generalised linear modelling techniques. 

Double platform, absolute abundance survey of cetaceans was also conducted in key habitats on the slopes and canyon systems of the Porcupine Bank & shelf edge system, primarily targeting offshore bottlenose dolphins and baleen whales.

Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) measurements also taken. A weather buoy was also deployed. ";
