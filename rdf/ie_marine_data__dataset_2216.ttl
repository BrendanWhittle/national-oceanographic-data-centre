    dct:abstract "Estimated annual average wave height (metres) created by a Pelamis Wave Model for Accessible Wave Energy Resource Atlas. Wave height values are measured as lower and upper values in metres as calculated by the Pelamis wave model. Annual average wave height covers an area known as the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Data model produced in 2005. The Pelamis Wave Model was an oceanographic model using the Pelamis wave energy converter device. The Accessible Wave Energy Resource Atlas was produced to provide data and information on the accessible wave energy resource potential around Ireland. Wave model developed by ESB International (ESBI) as part of the Accessible Wave Energy Atlas Ireland published by the Marine Institute and Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland. Model completed for time period run.";
