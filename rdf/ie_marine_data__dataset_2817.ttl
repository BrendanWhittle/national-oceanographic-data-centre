This dataset comprises data collected between 2004 and 2017 which has gone through detailed QA/QC. More recent data can be requested or downloaded from the Marine Institute through www.marine.ie. The dataset also includes the bathymetry of Lough Feeagh. The thermistor chain data are provided as a text file.
