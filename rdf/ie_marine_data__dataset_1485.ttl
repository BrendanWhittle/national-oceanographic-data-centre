    dct:abstract "Legs one,two and three of the 2017 Irish Anglerfish and Megrim Survey (IAMS) took place from 14th February to 17th March on RV Celtic Explorer in the North East Atlantic (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) area 7bcjk). Leg four (see CE17005) took place 8-17th April 2017 in ICES area 6a. Regions 6a and 7 are treated separately because they are comprise different assessment and Total Allowable Catch (TAC) areas. 

The surveys were conducted in order to obtain biomass estimates for anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa) and establish an abundance index for megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiaginis and L. boscii).

The IAMS survey is coordinated with the Scottish Anglerfish and Megrim Survey (SIAMISS) and uses the same gear and fishing practices. For this survey, sampling stations were selected at random. The gear, based on a standard commercial otter trawl, was trawled at 3kn for one hour at each station. All fish and invertebrate species were sorted and weighed. Biological data recorded on fish species include sex, maturity and age.  ";
