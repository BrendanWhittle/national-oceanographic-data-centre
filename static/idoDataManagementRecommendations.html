				<h2>Data Management Plans</h2>
				<h3>Why compile a Data Management Plan?</h3>
				<p>Data Management Plans are a key element of good data management practice, and as such are required by many funding bodies either before funding is released, 
				or as an early project deliverable. For example, in the European Commisssion's Horizon 2020 funding programme a Data Management Plan must be submitted withing
				the first six months of a project.</p>
				<p>A Data Management Plan can help to identify opportunities to reuse and share the data a project or programme is creating. It can also serve as an "early 
				warning" mechanism to help highlight and communicate any data or IT requirements and issues.</p>
				<h3>What is a Data Management Plan?</h3>
				<p>A Data Management Plan describes what data will be created during a project, how they will be stored during the project, how they will be archived at the end of the project and how access will be granted (where appropriate). Although a Data Management Plan should be prepared before a project begins, it must be referred to and reviewed throughout, as well as after the project, so that it remains relevant.</p>
				<p>Most data generated during a project can be archived and shared under the Marine Institute's Data Policy. However, some data will be classified as confidential, personal or sensitive under that Policy. sensitive than others. A Data Management Plan aids in identifying issues related to data confidentiality, data security and copyright before initiating a project.  Any challenges to data sharing (e.g. data confidentiality) should be critically considered in a Data Management Plan, with solutions proposed to optimise data sharing.</p>
				<h3>What to put into a Data Management Plan</h3>
				<p>It is recommended that a Data Management Plan covers the following broad areas:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Overview of the dataset to be produced by the project / programme</li>
					<li>How the dataset will be created or collected</li>
					<li>What documentation and supporting information (metadata) will be included with the dataset</li>
					<li>What legal or ethical considerations are needed in handling the dataset</li>
					<li>How the dataset will be stored & how it will be backed up</li>
					<li>Selectetion & preservation</li>
					<li>How the data will be shared and who it will be shared with</li>
					<li>Who will be responsible for carrying out the data management and what resources will be required to act on the Data Management Plan</li>
				</ul>
				A Data Management Plan template can be accessed <a href="../site-assets/dataManagementPlanTemplate.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

				<h2>Data Provenance</h2>
				<p>Within the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/" target="_blank">Findable Accessible Interoperable Reproducible (FAIR)</a> principles of data management:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Data must be described with rich metadata (that is information about the data</li>
					<li>Metadata must be registered in a searchable resource</li>
					<li>Metadata must be associated with detailed provenance</li>
					<li>Metadata must meet domain-relevant community standards</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In order to help acheive these aims, the Marine Institute's National Marine Data Centre has developed the data catalogue at <a href="http://data.marine.ie" target="_blank">data.marine.ie</a> and a set of guidelines for submitting both metadata and data.</p>
				<p>To generate an entry in <a href="http://data.marine.ie" target="_blank">data.marine.ie</a>, a minimum set of information tracing the provenance or lineage of a dataset is required. This allows data to be clearly traced back to its owner and originator to give them full credit for creating hte dataset, and also aids the reusability of the dataset. A provenance sheet template is available <a href="../site-assets/provenanceSheetTemplate.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, which should contain information on the following aspects of the dataset:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="topLevelProvenance">Dataset name</li>
					<li class="topLevelProvenance">Originator information</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Dataset owning organisation</li>
						<li>Contact details for a responsible team or individual in the dataset owning organisation</li>
						<li>If the data are published online, a URL to access the data</li>
					</ul>
					<li class="topLevelProvenance">Dataset details</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Dataset abstract - covering the "who", "what", "when", "where", "why" and "how" of the dataset's collection or creation</li>
						<li>A lineage statement - describing the processes and procedures used in the compilation or creation of the dataset and providing an audit trail for steps taken to modify any original data</li>
						<li>Time span of the dataset</li>
						<li>Spatial or Coordinate Refeernce System used in the dataset</li>
						<li>Detailed descriptions of the parameters contained within the dataset, where possible referencing terms from the British Oceanographic Data Centre's Parameter Usage Vocabulary (<a href="https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/vocabularies/vocabulary_search/P01/" target="_blank">P01</a>)</li>
						<li>When was the dataset last updated?</li>
						<li>When will the dataset be next updated?</li>
					</ul>
					<li class="topLevelProvenance">Dataset usage terms</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The license under which the data are being made available</li>
						<li>Are there any General Data Protection Regulation issues wirthin the dataset?</li>
						<li>Which of the classifications from the Marine Institute <a href="https://www.marine.ie/Home/sites/default/files/MIFiles/Docs/DataServices/Marine%20Institute%20Data%20Policy%202017.pdf" target="_blank">data policy</a> does the dataset fall under?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Open data</li>
							<li>Environmental data</li>
							<li>Reporting data</li>
							<li>Intermediate data</li>
							<li>Confidential data</li>
							<li>Personal data</li>
							<li>Sensitive personal data</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Can the data be made available for third parties to view or download (or both)?</li>
						<li>When should the data originator be nezt contacted to ensure all the information supplied remains up-to-date?</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<p>All datasets submitted to the National Marine Data Centre at the Marine Institute must be accompanied with a completed provenance sheet.</p>
